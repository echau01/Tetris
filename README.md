# Tetris

## Introduction

This project is a re-creation of [Tetris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris). The main action of the game
happens on a board with 20 rows and 10 columns. The goal of the game is to earn as many points as possible by 
manipulating falling *tetrominos* to fill the rows of the board. When all the cells of a row are filled with tetrominos,
the tetrominos in that row are deleted—this is called a *line clear*. More points are earned when the
player clears more lines at a time. The game ends if the player allows a tetromino to be placed at the top of the
board such that there is no space for the tetromino to fit.

This classic singleplayer game can be played by **anyone**. Tetris is still popular to this day—see [the intensive
finals of the 2018 Classic Tetris World Championship](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_UPHsGR6fM)). I decided to
re-create Tetris as a personal project because I have played some Tetris myself and am amazed at how such a simple 
game can be so fun.
